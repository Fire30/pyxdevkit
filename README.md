pyxdevkit: xdevkit for python
============================

Why?
------
I am a linux and python user by choice and debugging on the xbox is essentially the opposite. One is bascially confined to windows and C# or C++. This project allows you to debug across all platforms that python is supported, and is in python, so it is much more usable for me. Also why not?

Note
--------
This is early in development and I wouldn't use it for anything real right now. I will remove this when it is more stable.

Installation
-----------

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Fire30/pyxdevkit.git
$ cd pyxdevkit
$ python setup.py install
```

Hopefully I will put it on pip someday

Features
-------
 - Get Memory
 - Set Memory
 - Get Console Name
 - Connect as Debugger
 - Set Breakpoints
 - Start Execution After Break
 - Execute Function on Notification
 - Get Registers

Hopefully this will slowly increase over time.

Examples
--------
None 

Dependencies

None as of right now!
